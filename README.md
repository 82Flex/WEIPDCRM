Darwin Cydia Repository Manager<br />
This is an open source Repository Manager for Saurik's Cydia Clients.<br />
A repo means a repository and a apt source.<br />
It only supports chinese, and I hope somebody will translate my work into other languages. :(

This program is re-designed from tibounise's "DCRM", and I add almost 95% functions for a wonderful repo.
